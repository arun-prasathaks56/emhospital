        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Very few laboratory technologists of India realized that this particular category was very much neglected by the authorities. So they came forward and joined hands and established 
            Indian Medical Laboratory Technologists Association in the year 1970.the name changed to "ALL INDIA MEDICAL LABORATORY TECHNOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION" with its Headquarters at New Delhi.
             Later the constitution of the association was introduced to see the development of the cadre.
            The founder members of this association visited most of the States, Hospitals and Medical Colleges with the idea to bring all Laboratory Technologists on one platform to give strength to the Association.

             of their own state under the guidance of Central committee.
            The first All India Conference was organized at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The second at Patna and the third was at Kolkata and to hold All India Conferences every year and in 
            different states became a continuous process which is continuing.
